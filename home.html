<p>Hello! I'm Matthew, From Upstate New York I have alot of things that I am intrested in. You can see me spending my time usually by reading manga or playing video games. I plan to also get into some new hobbies. I'm very intrested in 3d printing and have decided that I will get a resin 3d printer in the future. I have 3d modeled some small stuff in the past but have never really gotten into it and I think it would be a good opportunity to join in. <br> </p>

<td>Soldering</td>
<td>I don't know much about soldering the first project I undertook failed miserbly I was going to throw my cheap $20 soldering iron away but decided to keep it. Recently I have soldered together a easier kit that was just a stick and poke kit. This kit was a christmas tree and was fairly fun. I have since gifted it to my grandmother for christmas she enjoys it. </td>

<td>Video Games</td>
<td>I have played alot of video games but my faviorate are made by FromSoft a japaneese game studio that had made notoriously hard games like Dark Souls,Armoured Core. Another one of my favorite companies is Valve which made the Portal and Half-Life 2 amazing series. My top 5 favorite video games are Dark Souls, Monster hunter, Portal, Half-Life and Black Myth Wukong. I do have to give a special mention though to Counter Strike 2 which I have over 2000 hours in which was a waste of time.</td>

<P> There has not been alot of recently good games the only one that comes to mind is black myth wukong. Which I am also working towards the 100% like my previous games that I have before cuphead, dark souls III, Monster Hunter World, the Portal and Half-Life series as well. So older titles is what I have been playing for now old rts games like age of empires II and metal slug. I would like to in the future get into unreal engine and try to make a small game using C++. <br></p>
